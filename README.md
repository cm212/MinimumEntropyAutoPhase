# MinimumEntropyAutoPhase
## this is a subroutine for estimating and correcting phase errors in pure absorption spectra
## This algorithm uses the entropy minimization method, with optional linear phase correction and negativity penalty
## Currently, 3 search options: brute force (0 order), simplex (0 order), simplex (0 and 1 order)
